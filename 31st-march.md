## Progress: 
* READ DOCUMENTATIONS ON:
* What state in React is
* How to use state in React
* What happens in React when state is changed
* Concept of Re-rendering

## Challenges:
* The useState hook - how the pattern for state defition with `useState` works. 
* Confusion with how is `useState` REALLY working behind the scene.

## Key Takeaways:
* When a component's state or props change, the component is _destroyed_ 
* **React Reconciliation Algorithm** - on re-rendering React generated a new virtual DOM. And then compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one and calculates the minimal set of changes to update the actual DOM.


## Next Steps:
* How to structure state.
* How state updates.
* Learn about controlled components.
