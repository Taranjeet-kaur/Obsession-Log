## Back After 3 Days

I broke my streak - 3 days without a log. No excuses. I saw something that made me rethink my approach, and I let that thought steer me off track. Lesson learned: breaks should be intentional, not accidental.

I'm back now, and I'm doublng down to rebuild momentum. 

Today,  spent my time refocusing and revisiting what made me start this in the first place. Tomorrow, I push harder.

## What I learned today:
* Rendering techniques in React. Solved one question for 'rendering a list of elements in JSX' and one for 'rendering a list of components in JSX'.
* What are props. Solved one question that taught me how to use props. 

## Challenges:
* Rendering a list of components in JSX was a little bit tricky.
