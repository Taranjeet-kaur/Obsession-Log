Bro.. these GitHub issue. After fixing that bug a few days ago, I was back at square one.

On top of that while trying to fix things I deleted everything- GOD LORD! I HAD BACKUPS. Otherwise I would have lost months of progress on `Obsession-Log`

I had to add all files manually from wrong folder to the right one. And then again add, commit and push them on Git.

And it worried me when I was pushing the files on GitHub but it wasn't showing up there. And after 2-3 days everything looks normal. 

EXCEPT there are 2 green letter on files now, (A,U = on the files that I add to Git. and U, U on the ones that I did not add at all.)

Now, I think, maybe.. just maybe, the issue is NOT with GitHub but with the VSC itself. Because the command lines are working fine and everything is now being pushed normally to GitHub after that `object files corruption` fix.

These issues cost me straight 2 days of no commits. UGH.
