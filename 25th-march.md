## Progress: 
* Recovered my logs after a freaking nightmare with Git.
* Manually added, committed, and pushed everything back, one by one.
* Manually added, committed, and pushed everything back, one by one.

## Challenges:
* Git. Justâ€¦ Git. Almost lost my mind after losing almost my whole day to fixing this issue.
* Accidentally created some recursive folder hell where logs were nested inside themselves like some cursed inception.
* Why hell? BECAUSE - I Spent way too much time fixing it, only to end up right back where I started.

## Key Takeaways:
* **Backups matter.** I would've lost everything if I hadn't had one.
* Git will do exactly what you tell it to do, even if that means destroying your sanity. 
* I hate this. I hate this. But I also kinda love this? 
* I'm relieved right now,though. It's 2:40 a.m. I WANNA SLEEEEEP.

## Next Steps:
* Set up an automated backup system so this NEVER happens again.
* Get back to actual coding instead of fighting Git all day.
