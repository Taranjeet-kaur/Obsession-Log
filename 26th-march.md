## Progress:
* In coding? None. But Git? yeah, kinda....?

## Challange:
* Whole git thing has been challenging after fighting with Git's object files corruption yesterday.
* Honestly, it's growth inducing to learn about the tool I rely on.
* It's also so time consuming and exhausting - that it affects my coding.
* But I believe this will help me after I get a job.

## Key takeaways:
* Stress less. There's nothing that's unfixable. 
* If it is, then well, start over. 
* JUST KEEP A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING- A MUST.
