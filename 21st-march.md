## Progress: 
* How to generate keys on the fly. 
* Index as keys are anti-pattern.
* Passing data between components.
* Function as props.
* Spread operator in React.
* Passing JSX as children.


## Challenges:
* Function as props was a bit confusing on how/where to make a function and then pass it to another component as a function.
* Passing JSX as children- really had to look it up what exactly is happening when JSX is being passed as children to another components behind the scenes.


## Key Takeaways:
* Creating keys on the fly is NOT a good practice. Use databases IDs.
* A good way to identify a child component or parents component is- is this component being used inside another component? If yes, it's a child otherwise it's a parent.
* Spread operator in React is for when all the props are being passed to another component. In this case, the 'spread' syntax makes it all faster to type and concise.

## Next Steps:
* Make a small project - 'Mini contact list' to reinforce the concept learned in these past few days and today [components, props, keys, passing data].
* Introduction to state 
* Read objects and object constructor in JavaScript.
* JavaScript : start the new project (Library) after reading the above article
