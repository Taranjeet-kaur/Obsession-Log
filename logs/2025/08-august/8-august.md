## Progress
* Covered nested classes concept and types:
> * Static Nested Class
> * Inner Class (Member Inner, Local Inner, Anonymous Inner)

* Practiced examples for Static Nested and Member Inner classes.

* Learned the syntax and purpose of Local Inner Classes â€” declared inside a method.

## Key Takeaways
* Inner/Nested classes are good to know but not used often in modern backend work.

* Anonymous Inner Classes are mostly replaced by lambdas in Java 8+.

* For now, focus on recognizing them in code rather than over-practicing.
