## Progress:
* Learned more about `throws.
* Difference between `throw` and `throws` completed.
* Since `finalize()` is deprecated and I already know `final` and `finally` well - decided to skipp the diff. btw them.
* Started Custom Exceptions - got the gist of it.

## Challenges: 
* Difference between `throw` and `throws` felt difficult - but everything clicked when I read the block of code of both side-by-side.


## Next Steps:
* All subtopics under Exception Handling done - practice 4-5 questions so that the connection between them all connects.

* Start learning about Multithreading in Java.
