## Progress:
* Learned wrapper classes and Autoboxing and Unboxing.
* Practiced questions on wrapper classes.

## Challenges:
*  Got confused how `Integer a = 128` and `Integer b = 128` are not the same but `Integer x = 100` and `Integer y = 100` 
*The former creates entirely new object because it is out of the -128 to 127 range. while the latter one is in the range and hence uses the same object.
