(Coming back from sickness. We're so back!!)

## Progress:
* what is Multithreading, Multitasking, and Multiprocessing.
* What is a Thread?
* How to create a thread (both ways: Thread class and implementing the Runnable interface)

## Challenges:
* Just a bit gap in knowledge - need to go in details of thread cycle.
