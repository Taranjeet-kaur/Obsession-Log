## Progress:
* Connected Java with MySQL using JDBC successfully.

* Ran a basic SELECT * FROM students query and printed results using ResultSet.

* Understood the JDBC flow: Driver loading → Connection → Statement → ResultSet → Close.


## Challenges:
* Table 'students' already existed.

* Column 'grade' was missing due to schema mismatch → resolved.
