## Progress:
* Understood that static methods are bound at compile-time and depend on reference type.
* Learned that non-static overridden methods are bound at runtime, based on actual object.
* Learned how to use final with variables, methods, and classes.
* Understood that runtime polymorphism needs overriding + upcasting.
* Practiced interpreting which method gets called based on object/reference type.

## Challenges:
* Got confused why static method in subclass isn’t called when using superclass reference.
* Needed clarity on how overloading vs overriding differs in decision timing.


## Key Takeaways:
* `static` → belongs to class, no overriding, early binding.
* `final` → prevents change: variable (no reassign), method (no override), class (no extend).
* Method Overloading → compile-time, Method Overriding → runtime.
* Upcasting + overriding = runtime polymorphism.
