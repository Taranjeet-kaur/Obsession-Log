## Progress:
* Practiced a question on `super()` keyword.
* Studied constructor chaining.
* solved a question on constructor chaining.
* Understood the core concept of upcasting (subclass → superclass) and how it's automatic and safe.
* Learned how downcasting (superclass → subclass) needs to be explicit and risky unless type is checked.

## Challenges:
* Needed clarity on when and why downcasting fails (ClassCastException if not done on actual subclass instance).
* Grasped that even though type is of superclass, actual object matters for behavior.


## Key Takeaways:
* Upcasting is automatic, used in polymorphism, and accesses only superclass methods (unless overridden).
* Downcasting is manual, useful to access subclass-specific features, but must be used safely with instanceof.
* Downcasting should never be used unless you're 100% sure of the object’s true type.


## Next Steps:
* Implement a code example with multiple subclasses (e.g., Cat, Dog, Bird) using polymorphism and casting.
* Practice using instanceof before downcasting.
