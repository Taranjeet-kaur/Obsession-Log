## Progress:
* **Interfaces**
* Learned how to define and implement interfaces in Java.
* Practiced polymorphism using interfaces (Playable, Skippable).
* Understood how a class can implement multiple interfaces, and how to call interface-specific methods using instanceof and typecasting.
* Explored the behavior of interface method visibility and why implemented methods must be public.

* **Encapsulation**
* Understood the principle of hiding class data using private variables and exposing controlled access through public getter and setter methods.
* Implemented validation logic inside setters to enforce data integrity.
* Saw how encapsulation increases security, maintainability, and prevents direct manipulation of object state.
