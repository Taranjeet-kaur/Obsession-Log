## Progress:

* Successfully implemented encapsulation in a custom class using private variables with getter and setter methods.

* Understood how to restrict direct access and control data flow using encapsulation.

* Learned to implement Association by using one class as a reference in another (user-defined custom class inside another class).

* Wrote clean, basic code to reflect a "has-a" relationship between classes.


## Challenges:
* Initially confused about how to use getters and setters â€” especially why getter has a return type and setter has void.


## Key Takeaways:
* Encapsulation is about protecting variables and exposing access via controlled methods (getters/setters).

* Association is about establishing a logical relationship between two classes without tight coupling.
