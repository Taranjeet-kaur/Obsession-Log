## Progress:
* **Interfaces**
* Learned how to define and implement interfaces in Java.
* Practiced polymorphism using interfaces (Playable, Skippable).
* Understood how a class can implement multiple interfaces, and how to call interface-specific methods using instanceof and typecasting.
* Explored the behavior of interface method visibility and why implemented methods must be public.

* **Encapsulation**
* Understood the principle of hiding class data using private variables and exposing controlled access through public getter and setter methods.
* Implemented validation logic inside setters to enforce data integrity.
* Saw how encapsulation increases security, maintainability, and prevents direct manipulation of object state.


## ⚠️ Challenges
* Initially struggled with casting interface types and understanding why a method wasn’t accessible.
* Faced compile-time errors due to missing public keyword while implementing interface methods.
* Needed to untangle how objects "hide" their full identity behind reference types and when instanceof is necessary.
* Confused about the actual benefit of encapsulation until the validation logic use case clicked.


##  Key Takeaways
* Interfaces allow pure abstraction and help define behavioral contracts across unrelated classes.
* instanceof + casting is a powerful combo to safely access multiple interface implementations from a single reference type.
* Both interfaces and encapsulation work toward clean, modular, and safe code design.
