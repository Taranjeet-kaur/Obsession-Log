## Progress:

* Understood how super is used to call superclass constructors, methods, and variables.

* Practiced reading and breaking down code that uses overridden methods and variable hiding.

* Completed one diagram-based output prediction and requested a custom coding prompt to deepen understanding.


##  Challenges:
* Variable hiding vs overriding needed slow processing. Still practicing mental model.


## Key Takeaways:

* `super()` must be the first line in a constructor if used.

* Variables are hidden, not overridden â€” so `super.variable` is essential when same name exists.

* Method overriding allows calling superclass logic using `super.method()`, helpful for extending behavior.
