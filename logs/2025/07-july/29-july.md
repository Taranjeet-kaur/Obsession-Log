## ✅ Progress
* Understood 2D arrays as a grid of rows and columns

* Wrote clean code to input and output matrices

* Successfully implemented search for a target element

* Fixed a bug caused by extra inputs and learned how Java reads console input

* Clarified how nested loops traverse 2D arrays


## Challenges
* Misinterpreted loop bounds (<= vs <)

* Confused about exclusive/inclusive nature of inputs

* Scanner input bug due to extra values carried over unexpectedly


## Key Takeaways
* Always use < rows and < cols in loops with arrays (Java is 0-indexed)

* Extra input can break logic — Scanner doesn’t clear buffer automatically

* Debugging console input is as important as logic
