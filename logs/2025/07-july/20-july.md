## Progress:

* #4 Count Even & Odd: Implemented a loop to check each number using modulo (% 2) to count evens and odds.

* #5 Search for an Element: Took a target input and searched through the array using a simple loop and condition. Printed "found" or "not found".

* #6 Find Max & Min: Learned the right logic to initialize max and min as the first element and compare using `arr[i]`, not `i`.

* #7 Reverse Array (Print Only): Understood the basic two-pointer logic but practiced the print-only version by using a reverse `for` loop.


## Challenges:
* Max/Min Bug: Initially compared index `i` instead of value `arr[i]` — caused wrong logic.

* Two-Pointer Confusion: At first, "start–end–swap" felt like DSA jargon, but breaking it into raw logic made it make sense.


##  Key Takeaways:
* Always compare values (`arr[i]`), not indices (`i`) in logic.

* Small mistakes (like wrong conditions or initialization) can completely change the output — slow down and debug calmly.
