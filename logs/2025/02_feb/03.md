# Learned: 
* Event delegation - adds a single event listner to the parent element instead of adding multiple event listners to the child elements. Event handlers = functions = ojects. More objects in the memory = slow performance = delay interactivity. 
* `element.dispatchEvent()` - programmatic way of generating an event. first use event constructur then use this method.

EVENT CONTRUCTOR: `type` is a string(event type such as 'click')
```js
let event = new Event(type, [,options]);
```
* Git Branching -> multiple alternate reality versions of a file at a time.

* Added DOM features in the "ROCK PAPER SCISSORS" game in simple_game repository. 

* Explained the entire `"ROCK PAPER SCISSORS"` game in README.md of `simple_game` repository

* Started a new project - `"Etch-a-Sketch"`
