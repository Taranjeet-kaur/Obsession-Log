## Progress:
* Problem 1: Palindrome check  - 

        1. Convert the string to lowercase.
        2. Remove spaces or non-alphanumeric characters (if required).
        3. Reverse the string and compare it with the original.
* Problem 2: Fibonacci sequence:

        1. Start with two variables holding the first two numbers.
        2. Use a loop to generate the sequence up to n.
        3. Store/return the result.
        
        

## Challenges:
*   Didn't know how to remove unwanted characters. 
*   Dint't know recursion
## Key Takeaways:
* String manipulation -considered special cases
* Understood edge cases - negative numbers not accepted. strings converted to numbers.

## Next Steps:
*   DOM manipulation and events
*   Revisit ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
