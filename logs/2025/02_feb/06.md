## What I learned:
* Working on some new minor features in `Void-Genesis`
* Started REACT.JS 
### `Etch-a-Sketch` logic:
* Dynamic grid creation in `Etch-a-Sketch` project
* Event handling (using `mouseover`, `event.buttons` to detect user interations)
* Randomized styling(applying random colors on interactions)
* Wrote the whole code twice to reinforce logic understanding PLUS make it concise and readable

## Struggles:
 * Got a bit confused when making `createDivs` function - whether to use single loop or nested loop. (picked nested loop, but i know single one is efficient and more neat)

## Next Steps:
* Add new features to both `Void-Genesis` and `Etch-a-Sketch` project
