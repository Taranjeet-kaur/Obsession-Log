# Progress:
* `reduce()` method - 
iterates and reduces an array's values into one value. similar to `forEach()` but added ability to collect the result of each iteration as a single value. 

```javascript
const findTheOldest = function(people) {
   return people.reduce((oldest,person)=> {
        const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

        let oldestAge = (oldest.yearOfDeath || currentYear) - oldest.yearOfBirth;

        let currentAge = (person.yearOfDeath || currentYear) -person.yearOfBirth;

        return currentAge > oldestAge ? person : oldest;
})
};
```
* The other way above problem was solved was:

```javascript
const findTheOldest = function(people){
    let oldestName = 0
    let oldestAge = 0

    for (let person of people) {
        let death = (person.yearOfDeath || new Date().getFullYear()) 

        let alive = death - person.yearOfBirth

        if(alive>oldestAge){
            oldestAge = alive 
            oldestName = person
        }
    }
    return oldestName
}
```

* `map()` method- a higher order function that iterates over each element of an arra and apply a specified function (callback function- a function passed as an argument) to each element. It creates a new array based on the result of aapplying callback function to each element in the of the original array, without modifying the original array.

```javascript
const getTheTitles = function(arr) {
    let titles = arr.map(({title}) => (title))
    return titles
};
```

* DOM manipulation -  
    > What is DOM? 
    > Difference between a "node" and an "element"
    > How to target a node?
    > How to create, add, remove and alter an element in the DOM?

# Struggle:

* Confusion about `reduce()`  in `findTheOldes` function.


# Key Takeaways:
* Found for loop more easy in `findTheOldest` problem but `reduce()` is efficient.
* DOM is a lot cooler than I thought. Especially the event listner. 

# Next Step:
