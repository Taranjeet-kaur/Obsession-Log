## What I learned?
* Solved TWO SUM problem on LeetCode.

## Struggles:
* Looks so simple yet confusing to understand hashing or HashMap.

## Key Takeaways:
* Difference between Brute Force and (n) lookups for fast searching.
* Hashing & Two pointer Techniques in Problem Solving.

## Next Steps: 
* Problem: Two Sum - Unique pairs (Given an array of integers and a target sum, return all unique pairs of numbers that add up to the target.)
* Continue with To-Do list project { `Void-Genesis` repo}.
* Make one feature for Etch-a-Sketch project.
