## What I learned & Did today:
* Started a project - An anime themed To-Do list 
* Local storage basics - learned about `setItem`and `getItem`.
* Typing Effect - Coded and Debugged `typeEffect` function and fixed logical errors.
* Event listeners - `DOMContentLoaded` , `keyup` etc 

## Struggles:
* Got stuck in logic for type effect function. 
* Fumbled for 2 days straight- commited in other repos but no in `Obsession-Log` (Literally doing this at 2:55 a.m.)
* Lol got stuck for 15 minutes wondering why the code wasn't working - found out I put an **extra bracket**.

## Next Steps:
* Convert the project into an actual **To-do list app** (though adding more animations, effect and sounds won't hurt anyone)
* Stop fumbling on small mistakes, ong.
* Push **BOTH** commits and Obsession Log updates regularly - **NOT just commits in other repos**.
