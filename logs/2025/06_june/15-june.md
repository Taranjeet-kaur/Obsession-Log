## Progress:
* Learned how classes act as blueprints, and objects are instances of them.

* Understood the use of the new keyword to create objects in memory.

* Clarified that new doesn’t copy the class but creates an independent version of it for the object.

* Used a real-world analogy (houses & families) to visualize how different objects can share structure but behave uniquely.

## Challenge:
* Wrapping my head around why new is needed every time we create an object.

* Doubts around whether the original class gets altered or destroyed (it doesn’t).

## Key Takeaways:
* Class = structure; Object = usable item built from it.

* new helps create separate objects so they don't interfere with each other.

* Changes made by one object do not affect the class or other objects.

## Next Step:
* Build a small OOP-based project using class & object to reinforce the concept through practice.
* Already on it- building a "Snarky To-Do Assistant"
