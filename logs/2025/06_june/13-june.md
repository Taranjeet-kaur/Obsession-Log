## Progress:
* Made a mini Java project: a basic password-protected journal.
* Used Scanner, conditionals, and a while(true) loop to simulate journaling with an "exit" condition.

## Challenge:
* Struggled with next() vs nextLine() and why input kept skipping.
* Learned that mixing them causes bugs unless I flush the buffer with nextLine() after next().


## Key Takeaways:
* Always use .equals() for string comparison.
* If I use next(), flush with nextLine() before using another nextLine().
* Journal project helped reinforce how real logic flows in loops and conditions.

## Next Steps:
* Slowly start documenting projects properly for GitHub.
