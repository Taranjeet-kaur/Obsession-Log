## Progress:
* Made a mini Java project: a basic password-protected journal.
* Used Scanner, conditionals, and a while(true) loop to simulate journaling with an "exit" condition.

## Challenge:
* Struggled with next() vs nextLine() and why input kept skipping.
* Learned that mixing them causes bugs unless I flush the buffer with nextLine() after next().
