## Progress:
*  Built a menu-driven calculator for basic math operations.

* Completed the menu-driven geometry area program using method calls.

* Solved the month-days mapping problem using switch-case (clean logic and structure).

## Challenges:
* Faced scope & redeclaration errors (e.g., reusing variable names).

* Misused return in void context — but clarified the idea of “returning a value to the calling point.”

## Key Takeaways:
* `return` sends a value back to the caller, like assigning a result to a variable.
* Void methods don’t return values — they just do something (e.g., print).
* Avoid redeclaring variables inside the same method block.
* Methods help keep logic clean and reusable — especially in menu-driven programs.
