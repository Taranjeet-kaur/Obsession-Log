## Progress:
* Built a working calculator in Java using static methods.
* Covered all major operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power.
* Learned to organize logic into separate methods and call them cleanly from main().

## Challenge:
* Missed some syntax details like method calls (nextInt()), inconsistent capitalization (Operation vs operation), and forgot break in one case — but spotted and fixed them.

## Key Takeaway:
* Static methods are powerful for utility logic.
* They reduce memory usage, improve structure, and make code easier to reuse.
