## Focus: Built and tested a modular Java calculator system from CLI

## Progress:

* Connected 3 modules: Math, Temperature, BMI

* Moved all .java files into a shared folder

* Compiled with javac *.java, ran with java MainMenu

* Logic worked cleanly without errors (well, just minor ones like syntax errors.)

## Challenge:

* Handling method calls across multiple files

* CMD navigation and PATH issues

* Mental fatigue from piecing everything manually

## Key Takeaway:
You donâ€™t need fancy tools. Structure, logic, and clarity are everything. You built a working CLI app using raw Notepad++ and grit.
