## Progress:
* Practiced Java programs: Fibonacci series, number reversal, and palindrome check.

* Explored star patterns and tried to understand their logic through nested loops.

* Asked deeper “why” questions instead of just accepting code blindly.

## Challenges:
* Star pattern logic felt unintuitive and frustrating.

## Next step:
* Practice how to visualize patterns before coding.
