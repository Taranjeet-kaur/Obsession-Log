## Progress:
* Solved multiple coding questions on the this keyword, learning how to correctly reference the current object’s variables inside methods.

* Practiced writing object-to-object comparison methods and carefully debugged mistakes where constructors were mistakenly called like methods.

* Studied object and static initializer blocks and successfully coded examples where both types of blocks worked together.

* Learned when static blocks run (once per class load) and when object blocks run (every time an object is created).

* Started Inheritance and understood the basic syntax and structure: how a child class inherits variables and methods from a parent class using the extends keyword.

## Challenges:
* Initially confused between constructor calls and method calls.

* At first, inheritance seemed easy but made me question how variables and methods would interact across parent and child classes.

## Key Takeaways:
* `this` always refers to the current object and allows direct access to its variables.

* Object initializer blocks run before the constructor for each new object.

* Static initializer blocks run only once when the class is loaded.

* Inheritance allows code reusability, where the child class automatically gets the parent’s properties and behaviors.

## Next Steps:
* Types of inheritance.
* Object class a root of Java class hierarchy.
