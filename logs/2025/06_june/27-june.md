## Progress:
* Practiced writing a custom constructor question independently.

* Applied constructor overloading using both default and parameterized constructors.

* Used instance variables to store individual member details.

* Correctly worked with static variables to manage shared data across all objects.

* Understood that static variables should be updated carefully (mistaken assignment was corrected).

## Challenges:
* Initially assigned static variable incorrectly inside the constructor:

> `gym = gymName;` â†’ reversed the assignment.

* Missed best practice of initializing static variables outside constructors.

* Learned the correct way to access and update static variables across objects.
