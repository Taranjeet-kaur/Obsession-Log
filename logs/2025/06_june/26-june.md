## Progress:
* Learned how to create constructors (default and parameterized).
* Practiced constructor overloading with multiple examples.
* Understood instance (non-static) vs static variables clearly:
> * Instance variables are unique per object.
> * Static variables are shared across all objects of the class.
* Practiced proper syntax, memory flow, and corrected small mistakes independently.

## Challenges:
* Initially didnâ€™t fully distinguish constructor overloading vs method overloading, but now I do.

## Key Takeaways:
* Constructors initialize objects and can be overloaded for flexibility.
* Instance variables belong to each object; static variables belong to the class.
