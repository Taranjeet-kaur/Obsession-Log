## Progress:
* Learned Single Inheritance:
Child class inherits variables and methods from the parent class (IS-A relationship).

* Learned Association:
One class holds a reference to another class (HAS-A relationship).

## Challenge:
* Felt confused about why we use a class as a data type instead of simple variables.

* Struggled to see the importance in basic examples that felt unnecessary for small problems.

* Needed a real-world, complex scenario to understand when classes are actually useful.

## Key Takeaways:
* Single inheritance helps reuse code and build parent-child class structures.

* Association is about linking classes without making them dependent on each other.

* Using a class as a data type keeps code organized when working with complex or real-world objects.

* Simple examples often hide the real power â€” classes truly shine when the project grows.
