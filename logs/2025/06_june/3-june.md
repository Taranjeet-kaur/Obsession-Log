## Progress:
* Explored nested loops deeply for the first time

* Began understanding the relation between rows (`i`) and columns (`j`)

* Wrote a few star patterns with and without help

* Understood that inner loop finishes before outer loop iterates again

* Accidentally created correct patterns by experimenting — a sign of intuition forming

## Challenges:
* Logic still felt like guesswork

* Couldn’t fully visualize the space vs star math

* Felt overwhelmed, angry, exhausted — but didn’t give up

* Brain overloaded, but refused to back down without some level of clarity

## Key Takeaways:

* Mastery doesn’t come after writing one correct pattern

* Nested loops can be visualized like row-column tables

* Conditionals inside inner loops decide whether to print space or star
