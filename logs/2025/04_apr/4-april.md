## Progress:
* Scheme - The setup information for database is stored in a specific file called the "Schema".
* CRUD actions - How to Create, Read, Update or Destroy data in a database.
* Mashing tables - `JOIN`, `ON` , `LEFT OUTER JOIN` ,   RIGHT OUTER JOIN` , `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
* A VISUAL EXPLANATION OF SQL JOINS:

* Did w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp lesson.

## Challenges:
* SQL JOINS were so confusing (and still are).



## Key Takeaways:
* Main actions are CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Destroy. 
* Most commands fall under "Read" category.


## Next Steps:
* Using functions to aggregate data.
* Assingments for SQL - Go throught these interactive SQL tutorial from SQL Teaching `https://www.sqlteaching.com/` 
* Take it slow- these lessons are not short. It'll take a while. FOCUS ON THE CONCEPTS.
