## Progress:
* INNER JOINS QUESTIONS.
* How to compare dates and return a value or list of values.
* Purchased JAVA + DSA course. Looking forward to the classes starting from tomorrow

## Challenge:
* The biggest challenge has been for past few days are - not being able to focus for longer time like I can most of the time.
* Inner joins are confusing ngl. Need to practice or visualize how the joins are actually happening to understand it deeply.

## Key Takeaways:
* Even half an hour to one hour focus per day is a good consistency. Don't beat yourself up for not being able to focus properly for some time. 

## Next Steps:
* Do a few more questions on inner joins.
* Multiple Joins.
* Joins with WHERE.
