## Progress:
* Did lessons from SQL teaching.
* Learnt about AND, OR, IN, 
* DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT,
* COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX AND MIN, GROUP BY
* Did nested queries

## Challenge:
* Nested queries are confusing. I'm making mistakes in that one. SO, definitely need to work on that.

## Next Steps:
* Practice nested queries
* NULL
* DATE 
* Try ending the rest of the topics from SQL teaching.
