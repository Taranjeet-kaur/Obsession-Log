## Progress:
* What a database is.
* What relational databases are.
* In what way relational databases are different from XML.
* What SQL is.
* What SQL is used for.
* How to get all the records from a table in SQL.
* How to insert a record in SQL.

## Challenges:
* Just remembering the syntax for SQL. Not a big deal though. Got a hang of it in just an hour.
