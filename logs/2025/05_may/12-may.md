## Topics covered: 
* Typecasting
* Data type sizes & conversions (long, float, double)
* Java Operators (Unary & Binary)
* Pre/Post Increment behavior
* Practice expression: System.out.println(x++ + ++x);

## Progress:
* Understood Typecasting:
-> ✔️ Implicit (widening) vs Explicit (narrowing)
-> ✔️ Why float (4 bytes) can't hold a long (8 bytes) — it's about range, not size.
* Practiced tricky expression:
-> `System.out.println(x++ + ++x)` — You nailed the step-by-step evaluation!

## Challenges:
* Confusion between memory size (bytes) and value range.
* Differentiating between when casting is automatic vs when it's required.
* Initially mixed up postfix/prefix increments.
