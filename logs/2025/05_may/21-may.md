## Progress:
* Practiced Java basics:

>* Checked if two integers are equal

>* Determined if a number is positive/negative

>* Categorized height based on input

* Planned logic to find the largest of three numbers (no code yet)

 
## What I Learned:
Importance of clean syntax (System, variable names)

Proper use of Scanner and if-else

Thought before coding â€” focused on logic first

## Mistakes Noted:
* Typos like Sytem and wrong variable references

* Tried calling .close() on a non-Scanner object
