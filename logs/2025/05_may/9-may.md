## Progress:
* Variable Types (instance, static, local)
* Literals (integer, floating-point, boolean)
* Practiced small code snippets to observe behavior of variables, literals, method overloading and object creation.


## Challenges:
* Why `.class` file couldn't be executed using java `TestVariable.class`.
* Literal rules


## Key Takeaways:
* Java literals are fixed values assigned to variables — int, float, char, etc.
* Method overloading helps the same method name serve multiple data types safely.
* Unicode is a character set, UTF-8 is an encoding format — not the same but related.
* You don’t write `.class` after the class name when running Java from the command line:


## Next Steps:
* Fix the MySQL server problem.
* Watch the lecture video.
Create a "Java Fundamentals" notebook or markdown log to keep syntax + examples.
