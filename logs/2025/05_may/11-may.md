## MySQL Setup and Reinstallation
 (Yesterday's attempt didn't work)

* Faced issues with MySQL installation and server connection.
* Attempted multiple fixes, including resetting paths and modifying file permissions, but encountered errors with access and configuration.

* Realized that a small issue with path formatting was causing the server to fail to start properly.

* Tried using mysqld --skip-grant-tables but ran into permission-related issues and file access restrictions.

* After multiple attempts, decided to reinstall MySQL completely, including Workbench and server components, to clear up the errors.

* Reinstalled MySQL using the full installer, adjusting the service and user permissions during the setup.

* Awaiting proper configuration and setup once the download finishes.

## Next Steps:

* Finish reinstalling MySQL.
* Ensure MySQL Workbench is properly installed and able to connect to the server.

## Reflections:

* It's frustrating to hit a wall with configuration issues, especially after spending hours troubleshooting without success. Realized that sometimes a fresh installation is necessary to reset everything.

* Will continue with a more focused approach next time and ensure that permissions and paths are set up correctly from the start.
