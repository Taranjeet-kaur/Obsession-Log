# Obsession Log - 8th May 2025

## Progress
Today, I learned about Java variables. I explored how to declare, initialize, and use variables in Java, including different data types like `int`, `double`, `boolean`, and `String`.

## Challenge
Understanding the scope of variables and how they behave in different contexts (e.g., local vs. global variables, static variables) was a bit tricky.

## Key Takeaway
Variables in Java are strongly typed, and choosing the right data type is crucial for efficient memory usage and avoiding errors.

## Next Steps
- Practice writing small programs using different types of variables.
- Learn about constants and the `final` keyword in Java.
- Explore variable scope and lifetime in more depth.
- Experiment with type casting and conversions.
