# LOGS

**This folder contains subfolders, each representing a year.**

**Inside each year, logs are further divided into months, and each day has its own `.md` file.**

## Structure

`Years` -> `Months` -> `Days`

Every day is logged. **No empty spaces. No excuses**

## Purpose

This isn't just documentation. It's a record of discipline and evolution.  Every log is a proof of progress- every failure, every breakthrough, every lesson. The goal is simple: **Mastery.**
